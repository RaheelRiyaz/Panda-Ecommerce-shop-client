                Fashion is a term used interchangeably to describe the creation
                of clothing, footwear, accessories, cosmetics, and jewellery of
                different cultural aesthetics and their mix and match into
                outfits that depict distinctive ways of dressing (styles and
                trends) as signifiers of social status, self-expression, and
                group belonging. As a multifaceted term, fashion describes an
                industry, styles, aesthetics, and trends.

                A thirsty Crow found a Pitcher with some water in it, but so
                little was there that, try as she might, she could not reach it
                with her beak, and it seemed as though she would die of thirst
                within sight of the remedy.

                Every man carries Two Bags about with him, one in front and one
                behind, and both are packed full of faults. The Bag in front
                contains his neighboursâ€™ faults, the one behind his own. Hence
                it is that men do not see their own faults, but never fail to
                see those of others.
